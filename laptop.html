                    <p>Choosing a new laptop is a lot harder than it should be.
                        Every major brand has multiple product lines with overlapping prices and features,
                        and every description is filled with jargon about processors, types of storage,
                        graphics capabilities, screen resolutions and a laundry list of ports and connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>These are basical things you need to figure out to choose laptop:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pick a size</li>
                        <li>Decide screen resolution</li>
                        <li>Decide a form factor</li>
                        <li>Work out your ideal keyboard</li>
                        <li>Do you want a Touchpad?</li>
                        <li>Decide connectivity</li>
                        <li>What performance do you need?</li>
                        <li>Decide your graphics needs</li>
                        <li>Battery life</li>
                        <li>Storage</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After thinking about these topics you can realize what type of laptop you need. 
                            Nowadays there are some common categories of machines, which can help to narrow your search.
                            Some of these categories are listed below with the examples of recommended by LaunchBox products.

                <p>There's something quite liberating about getting an awesome gaming laptop.
                     The idea that you can play all the best PC games anywhere you want without 
                     sacrificing performance is the dream.  </p>
                <p>So what should you look for in the best gaming laptop? 
                    It really comes down to how far you can stretch your wallet. 
                    For the best gaming performance, you want something with at least 
                    an RTX 2060 or 2070 graphics card, though you might be able to find a handful
                     of systems with higher-end GTX cards for cheaper. For the display, 
                     we recommend an IPS screen at 120Hz and an i7 processor. 
                     If you're being more cost conscience, make sure you don't get anything 
                     less 16GB of RAM or a 256GB SSD, as those are corners that cheaper laptops tend to cut.</p>
                <p>Everything else is really up to you. Jet setters will need a good battery life for travel. 
                    If you plan on watching or editing tons of video, OLED screens are absolutely stunning for that. 
                    A decent built-in webcam for video calls is often very overlooked on gaming laptops as well. 
                    At the end of the day, think about what's important to you and go from there. 
                    Either way, this list has got all sorts of killer laptops for whatever you need. </p>

                        no matter if you’re on a train in Europe, at a café, or in between classes.</p>

                        the best processors and SSDs out there. They truly are powerful little devices
